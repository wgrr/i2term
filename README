lukeidraw

lukeidraw takes an image file (it supports only jpeg, png and gif
encoding) and prints a formated output that has image dimensions and
current terminal position in current terminal character size.

lukeidraw was built hoping it would be useful to solve a specific
problem shown in Luke Smith's video:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bocb8diNJA8

The output is meant to be parsed by external programs, its output is
formated as following:
	imageWidth imageHeight termCurrentRow termCurrentColumn

Example:
	lukeidraw img.png # 30 96 39 1

To be built, lukeidraw requires Go 1.11.
