lukeidraw
===

lukeidraw takes an image file (it supports only jpeg, png and gif formats) and
prints a formated output that contains size of image and current terminal position.

lukeidraw was built hoping it would be useful to solve a specific problem shown
in Luke Smith's video: 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bocb8diNJA8

The output is meant to be parsed by external programs, its output is formated as:
	imageWidth;imageHeight-termRow;termColumn

Example:
	lukeidraw img.png
	// 800;600-39;1

To be built, lukeidraw requires Go 1.11.
